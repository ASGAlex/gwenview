Gwenview - http://gwenview.sourceforge.net



-> What is it ?

Gwenview is a simple image viewer for KDE. It features a folder tree window
and a file list window to provide easy navigation in your file hierarchy.
Image loading is done by Qt library, so it supports all image formats your
Qt installation supports.


-> Requirements

KDE 3.0 or more.
As of version 0.14, Gwenview requires KDE 3.0.


-> Installation

 ./configure
 make
 make install

If configure fails to find your Qt or KDE libs, you will have to type
  'export KDEDIR=/path/to/kde'
and 
  'export QTDIR=/path/to/Qt/lib'


-> Uninstallation

 make uninstall


-> Tips concerning docked windows

Docked windows are great, but they take a little time to get
accustomed to. Here comes a few tips that you might find handy.

- While dragging a window, press Esc to cancel the drag.

- After undocking a window, if you want to dock it back, don't drag it
with the title bar, it won't dock. Drag the little horizontal grip
below the title bar instead. You may also click on the small arrow in
the top right corner, this will get it back to its previous docked place.

- If you closed a window you can get it back using the "Window" menu.

- To dock window A on an edge of window B, drag the grip of A to the wanted
edge. To make A and B use tabs, drag the grip of A on the center of B.


-> Keyboard navigation

When you move in the file list using the arrow keys, the selected image
isn't displayed immediatly : you must press the Enter key to display it.
This allows you to move directly from an image to another without loading
all images between them.
To browse images without having to press Enter, use the 'previous' and 'next'
shortcut keys, which are BackSpace and Space by default (You can change them
to whatever you want using the shortcut configuration dialog)


-> Mouse operations

You can browse through your image using the Opera-like previous-next mouse
navigation : Keep the left mouse button down and click on the right button to
go to the next image. Keep the right mouse button down and click on the left
button to go to the previous one.
Thanks to Michael Spanier for sending me a patch which started this new feature.

You can also scroll your image by holding the left mouse button down and
moving the mouse around.


-> Mouse wheel

Version 0.13 bring customizable mouse wheel behaviours : you can assign
different actions to the mouse wheel depending on whether it's used with
Control, Shift, Alt or no keys.
The available actions are :
- Scroll
- Browse
- Zoom


-> About thumbnail cache

Thumbnails aren't loaded everytime you browse a folder. Images are loaded once
and the thumbnail is then stored on disk. Next time you browse the folder,
Gwenview will use the saved thumbnail instead of reloading the image.
Until version 0.10.0, thumbnails were stored in .pics folders created in the 
image folder. Beginning with version 0.10.1, thumbnails are now stored in a
common folder : ~/.kde/share/thumbnails, like Konqueror 2.2 does.

If you want to get rid of all the .pics folders created by previous versions of
Gwenview, you can run this command from the folder to clear :

 find -name .pics -exec rm -rf {} \;
